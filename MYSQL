PROBLEM: 
A university stores students 'standardized test scores in a table named STUDENT. Student X placed 213^(th) on the test
Write a query to find student X's test score (i.e.., the 213^(th)highest STUDENT>SCORE in STUDENT).
A Table is provided: STUDENT.

Schema

         STUDENT

Name       Type      Description     

ID        Integer    The Student unique ID. This is a primary key

AGE       Integer    The Student's Age
 
SCORE     Integer    The Student's standardized test score

Sample Data Table

ID    AGE   Score

1     19    91
2     20    90
3     20    87
4     21    72
5     19    98
6     20    50

The Table's Score (from highest to lowest) are (90,91,90,81,72,50).As an example the fourth-highest score is 87. For the real query, find the 213yh highest score.

QUERY

SELECT Score
FROM(
SELECT DISTINCT SCORE 
FROM STUDENT
ORDER BY SCORE DESC
)AS score
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 212;
